# SL-HOI
Implementation of [Streamlined Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.27500) (CVPR 2026)

## Overview

In this paper, we present SL-HOI, a streamlined one-stage framework for open-vocabulary HOI detection built upon the DINOv3 model. We leverage the complementary strengths of DINOv3's backbone and vision head to effectively address both interactive human-object detection and open-vocabulary interaction classification tasks. Our design includes a novel two-step interaction classification process that bridges representation gaps and enhances feature utilization. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate that SL-HOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary HOI detection while maintaining a simple architecture with few trainable parameters.

## Data Preparation

### SWIG-HOI

SWIG-HOI dataset preparation follows [THID](https://github.com/scwangdyd/promting_hoi). Please refer to their documentation for download and setup instructions.

```

 |   |─ swig_trainval_1000.json
 |   |─ swig_test_1000.json
```

### HICO-DET

HICO-DET dataset preparation follows [GEN-VLKT](https://github.com/YueLiao/GEN-VLKT). Please refer to their documentation for download and setup instructions.

```

```

## Model Weights

All model weights are available on HuggingFace: [Thatmakes11/SL-HOI-weights](https://huggingface.co/Thatmakes11/SL-HOI-weights)

- `params/` - Pre-computed HOI classifier weights (`swig/` and `hico/`)
- `pretrained/` - Trained checkpoints (`swig/`, `hico/`, `hico_ov/`)

DINOv3 pretrained weights are available at [facebookresearch/dinov3](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3).

HOI classifier weights can also be generated using the provided scripts:

```bash
python swig_offline_classifier.py \
    --dinotxt_weights <path_to_dinov3_text_head_and_vision_head_weights> \
    --backbone_weights <path_to_dinov3_backbone_weights> \
    --bpe_path_or_url <path_or_url_to_bpe_vocab>

python hico_offline_classifier.py \
    --dinotxt_weights <path_to_dinov3_text_head_and_vision_head_weights> \
    --backbone_weights <path_to_dinov3_backbone_weights> \
    --bpe_path_or_url <path_or_url_to_bpe_vocab>
```

By default, the classifier weights will be saved in `params`

## Training

Training scripts are provided in `scripts/`:

- `scripts/swig.sh` - Training on SWIG-HOI
- `scripts/hico.sh` - Training on HICO-DET
- `scripts/hico_ov.sh` - Training on HICO-DET with zero-shot setting

Modify the following variables in the scripts to match your environment:

```bash
EXP_DIR="/media/qdu/2.0T/zgy/projects/SL-HOI/exps/hico"                    # Experiment output directory
DATA_DIR="/media/qdu/2.0T/zgy/projects/SL-HOI/data/hico_20160224_det/"      # Path to dataset
DINO_DIR="/media/qdu/2.0T/zgy/projects/SL-HOI/weights/dinov3"     # Path to DINOv3 weights
```

Then run:

```bash
bash scripts/swig.sh
```

## Evaluation

Evaluation scripts are provided in `scripts/`:

- `scripts/swig_eval.sh` - Evaluate on SWIG-HOI
- `scripts/hico_eval.sh` - Evaluate on HICO-DET
- `scripts/hico_ov_eval.sh` - Evaluate on HICO-DET with zero-shot setting

Place the provided checkpoints in the `pretrained` folder. Modify only `DATA_DIR` in the evaluation scripts to point to your dataset, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/hico_eval.sh
```

### Performance

| Dataset | Setting | Unseen | Rare | Non-rare/ Seen | Full | Checkpoint |
|---------|---------|--------|------|----------------|------|------------|
| SWIG-HOI | - | 19.04 | 24.69 | 30.62 | 24.67 | `pretrained/swig/pytorch_model.bin` |
| HICO-DET | Default | - | 47.71 | 44.25 | 45.05 | `pretrained/hico/pytorch_model.bin` |
| HICO-DET | Zero-shot | 40.53 | - | 42.99 | 42.49 | `pretrained/hico_ov/pytorch_model.bin` |

Checkpoints are available in the [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/Thatmakes11/SL-HOI-weights).
